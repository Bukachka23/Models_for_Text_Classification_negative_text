# Neural Network Models for Classification Negative Comments
This repository contains Python code that demonstrates the construction and evaluation of neural network models for text classification using TensorFlow and Keras. Specifically, it showcases the implementation of models with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) layers.

## Overview
Text classification is a common natural language processing task, and neural networks have proven effective in handling it. This code provides examples of building and evaluating three types of neural network models: CNN, LSTM, and GRU.

## Dependencies
Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy
- tensorflow
- re
- string
- keras
- scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy tensorflow scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed.

3. Open the Python script named text_classification_models.py.

4. Run the script in your preferred Python environment.

5. The script demonstrates the following steps:

6. Data preprocessing and loading (assumed to be done externally).

7. Building and compiling a neural network model using a Sequential API.

8. Training and evaluating the model for text classification.

9. Displaying a summary of the model architecture.

10 Repeat these steps for each type of model (CNN, LSTM, GRU) by uncommenting the relevant code sections and commenting out the others.

## Results

The script will output training logs and evaluation results for each model, including accuracy metrics and a summary of the model architecture.
